        <h3 class="text-info">Description:</h3>
        <p>SCP-007 is a male human, approximately 25 years of age, of European descent. Subject is in good health and shows no signs of physical or mental abnormality, except for the presence of a spherical region of space approximately 60 cm in diameter located in the subjectâ€™s abdominal cavity.</p>
        <p>This region appears to be a miniature ecosystem, containing soil, grass, and a small central body of water. Weather patterns have been observed within the anomaly, including rainfall and occasional cloud formation. The subject does not appear to experience any discomfort from the presence of this anomaly, nor does it interfere with normal bodily functions.</p>
        <p>The origin of SCP-007 is unknown. Subject claims to have been born with the anomaly, though no records exist to verify this. Attempts to probe or analyze the anomaly have been met with resistance from the subject and have yielded inconclusive results.</p>
